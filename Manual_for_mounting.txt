User Guide for hosting a shared File Server and mounting a Shared File System
=============================================================================

Pre-requisite:
1. Samba should be already installed on system.
2. Cifs-util tools should be installed on system for mounting.

Hosting Shared File System on Linux : 
------------------------------------
Following are the steps to host Shared File System on Linux:

1. Open Terminal and type
   cd /home/ndt
   
2. Type following commands:
   sudo chmod 777 create_share.sh
   sudo bash create_share.sh <shared_folder>

Note: Assuming that the user directory is /home/ndt and script "create_share.sh" is placed at user directory 

Where, <shared_folder> is the name of the shared folder

Eg.: sudo bash create_share.sh share

This step will create the shared folder /home/ndt/share

To verify the share is created successfully, access share folder: 
smb://<ndt-server>/<shared_folder>


Mounting Shared File System :
-----------------------------
Pre-requisite test.
1. The shared location of server is accesible through smb. Can be checked by opening location 
smb://<ndt-server>/<shared_folder>


Following are the steps to mount the Shared File System:

1. Open Terminal and type
   cd /home/ndt
   
2. Type following commands:
   sudo chmod 777 mount_script.sh
   sudo bash mount_script.sh <network-location> <mount-point>
   
   Where, <network-location> is the network path to the NDT shared file system 
   and <mount-point> is the path of the local mount point
   
  Eg.: sudo bash mount_script.sh //ndt-server-IP/share /mnt/share
  
  Note: If you receive an error similar to the following, it is likely that NDT shared file system is not accessible by name:
  Mount error: could not resolve address for ndt-server: Unknown error
  Using the IP address of the NDT shared file system in the network path should correct this issue.
   
Note: Assuming that the user directory is /home/ndt and script "mount_script.sh" is placed at user directory 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Precautions /Possible errors faced:

1. Mounted location not shown after boot up of system. 

Mounting script needs to be run once on system for a particular mounting location(/mnt/share) only.
At boot up Samba service and mounting service might run into race condition, resulting in failure of mounting.
Run following command on Terminal, before running NDT services on the system:

sudo mount -a;

This would mount all pending mountings.
 
2.  Common reason for failure of mouting script.

Make sure /mnt/share is not already mounted,  to check run command
mount | grep /mnt/share
There should be no entry if unmounted.

If it is mounted,Do unmouting by:-
sudo umount -f /mnt/share
